How UTF-8 encodes character ID & the different between string length and string size
---
Tom Scott best descirbes the encoding of UTF-8, and my description of it would end up paraphrasing his video;

<iframe style="margin-left: calc(45% - 250px);" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MijmeoH9LT4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After watching that video you will know enough to understand that a single character can span across multiple bytes, thus if a string includes a multi-byte character then the actual number of bytes within a string (it's size) is not the same as the number of characters within the string (it's length).

My personal preference

When it comes to tabs VS spaces I will always choose tabs with a good IDE.  
When typing it requires fewer button presses for my prefered visual indentation (2 spaces), as well as allowing for easier indentation changing when re-writing code.  
Also if you are using a good IDE it will let you change the number of columns that a tab displays at. Allowing for individuals to for with what visually looks like different indentations, while still appearing consistent, since the change in indentation is only a visual effect, rather than a data change.

Why is this here
---

## Purpose
This blog is not intended to be a repository of knowledge, instead, it is supposed to reflect some of my advanced computing knowledge, as well as allow me to link people to explanations of topics of which I have had to discuss multiple times.

## Production
I made this blog from scratch to mirror the functionality of GitHub's Jekyll. I did this because Jekyll has a lot of overhead installation and setup for use on windows, and I knew that there could be a better way.  
Thus I made this system.

Written using NodeJS, I have created a custom flavour of Markdown. One of the specialities of this flavour includes built-in equation formatting.

**Note**: The formatting of my markdown is a direct clone of GitHub's, with very small changes.  
Also feel free to use and edit my system for your own blogs.

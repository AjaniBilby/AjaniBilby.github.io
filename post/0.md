I made this blog from scratch to mirror the functionality of GitHub's Jekyll. I did this because Jekyll has allot of overhead installation and setup for use on windows, and I knew that there could be a better way.  
Thus I made this system.

Written using NodeJS, I have created a custom flavor of Markdown. One of the specialities of this flavor includes built in equation formatting.

**Note**: The formatting of my markdown is a direct clone of GitHub's, with very small changes.  
Also feel free to use and edit my system for your own blogs.

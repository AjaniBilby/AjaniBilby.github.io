# Two's Complement Integer

Two's complement integer (TCI) is a special way of encoding signed ($+$/$-$) integers in a way that the standard method of addition for integers still applies.  
The way it does this is by having the leading bit is equivalent to a sign (0 means positive and 1 means negative), however when a number is negative numbers start at the highest possible bit combination and works down.

| Decimal | Binary TCI |
|--:|:--|
|  0 | ``000`` |
|  1 | ``001`` |
|  2 | ``010`` |
|  3 | ``011`` |
| -4 | ``100`` |
| -3 | ``101`` |
| -2 | ``110`` |
| -1 | ``111`` |

While this looks kind of weird, and is hard to initially get your head around, what makes this system special is when you try addition.
$$
1 + (-2) = (-1)
$$
$$
001 + 110 = 111
$$

or
$$
3 + (-2) = (1)
$$
$$
011 + 110 = 001
$$

As you can see it just works, no custom methods needed for when an integer is negative or positive, it doesn't matter, addition still works the same.

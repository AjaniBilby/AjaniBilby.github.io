    If you didn't get this link directly from me, I would appreciate if you don't read this so I don't die of embarrassment.
    However I should probably just focus more on accepting who I am and not being afraid of other's finding out.

I think a lot of online dating is mostly just people trying to work out if they want to try and get invested in a person.
Having small talk trying to work out if they're even worth your time, or you should just jump to the next person.

Personally I feel like if you don't genuinely try with someone, you likely might miss a good potential partner, especially since everyone is kind of weird the first time they meet someone.
But to help with this process a bit I've made this document, so you can skim through to check your own criteria and get invested before even starting small talk.

## Relationship

### What I can give

I really love being able to care for someone - by this I don't mean baby them, or toxic levels of positive treatment,
but I love being able to be there see the joy on someone's face as they tell me the great thing that happened today.
Being able to be there ready to help comfort them after they've gone through something stressful when they didn't even ask for it, or directly tell me it was going to happen.
To be able to learn the little oddities, the things you do that others might find weird, or that you're self concious of and adore the uniqueness of you.

To be there for the good times, but also not shy away from the bad.

Of course I'm only human, and I can never guarantee I will always be able to be this for you, it is who I want to be and enjoy being and will continue to strive towards.

### What I want

The section above was supposed to be what I can give, but re-reading it, it also kind of describes what I want to give as well - maybe I'm a bit selfish xD

The thinks I want I don't expect to get immediately, or that I will get all of them, I think a good relationship is one that adapts to each other at least a some level.
I am certainly a weird person, what sort of guy writes all of this and attaches it for any girl to see, let alone the fact you could just give this link to anyone, and then anyone can read it...

In some ways I am certainly a weird person, I don't need someone who can fall in love with my weirdness, but I would like someone who at least appreciates the trade offs - "yeh, he's a bit weird but...", "it's kind of annoying how he ... but ...".

I want someone who can appreciate my attention, that doesn't mean saying thank you every time, if I keep doing it until the day we die, it would become common place, and kind of expected and I wouldn't blame you for that either.
I don't know quite how to put it, but it's a look in the eyes of genuinely being grateful for someone's presence, I don't need the lip-service of explicitly saying "thankyou", though occasionally it would still be nice.

I want someone who's hand I can hold, someone I can lay with and feel completely myself and at home with.
Someone who doesn't necessarily understand why I am the way I am being a bit of an odd ball, but understand that I am an odd ball and accepts me for that.

It's a lot to ask of someone I haven't even spoken to, and it's certainly not something you'll feel likely even after a third date.

But as long as you and I have a good time in our early dates working out if we can work out, it's not the end of the world if we decide it doesn't work, because I enjoyed the short time I spent working that out.


## Family

My parents moved away from all of my extended family for reasons they didn't tell me until I was 18, because they didn't want it to spoil the times I did have with them.
But after learning the reasons why I don't blame them for their choices.

But because of that I'm not really used to the idea of extended family, so if I do end up dating someone with a large connected family, it may take me a bit to get used to it.

## Pets and Animals

I really love wild birds, watching them just do their own thing, investigating the world, and playing around with each other.
I don't think I'd ever want a pet bird, because the thing I love most about them is watching how free their are, and I can't give them that in a 2-bedroom apartment ðŸ™ƒ

But I also don't feel like I need to own a bird either, since when I first moved to Sydney I used to often go to a park near where I lived, and sit with the geese, and other water birds.
Eventually I earned enough trust I could stroke a lot of them a single time in exchange for food (normally lettuce, because it's close to their natural diet).
I even managed to get one of them comfortable enough I could pick them up and put them on my knee, and I just had a single hand out to support their balance, and they didn't even try and run away.
He was quite comfortable there.

Eventually I had to move away from that area, and coming back - that particular goose is gone.
It's a little melancholy, but I enjoyed my time, and I think he (the goose) did too, so it was worth it, and I don't regret anything.
The only think I regret is that I didn't come back soon enough, because now the other geese don't feel comfortable around me any more ðŸ˜¤

### Dogs

There are a lot of dogs I've met in Sydney that I've disliked, but I don't think it's because I dislike dogs.
I just like ill-mannered dogs, which is a side affect of poor training.

I.e. the wet dog at the park which doesn't come back to it's owner and has decided it would come up to me on my picnic blanket and try and rub it's muddy body on me, when I'm trying to not give it any attention so it will go away...
The only time I've met a big dog I've liked was when I was growing up in the country side. I'm not sure if that's because big dogs require large amounts of space to be well behaved, or just because the owners actually trained them well.

But small dogs are cute, and small well trained ones doubly so.

### Cats

The only people I've ever met that have actually disliked cats are normally ones that don't know how to control their own tempor, or how to understand others...
That being said if I live with a cat that catches wild life, it will be reprimanded. Not with the goal of punishment, but the goal of convincing it catching wild life just isn't a good idea.
I think good training always needs some form of actual punishment so it will learn to honour you, but you also need to make sure you never push it too hard, because you want it to have a happy life and actually like you.


## Leisure

Just too be clear, while I do enjoy these things, and for now they do consume a bit of my life, it's more like I'm filling them empty space with them.
I am completely okay with cutting down on these activities to do other leisure activities, or helping out and maintaining a good relationship with you.

### Sports

In highschool I had a group of friends I used to do open's sports with after school.
These aren't extra-curricular, or after school things, but literally joining the local sports events.
I used to really love doing Volleyball in winter/autumn, then switching to netball for spring/summer.

But I had my group of friends to fall back on, and start to integrate into the larger group of everyone playing.
I moved to Sydney, and all of my friends moved to other difference cities for university, so I lost that group,
and I tried joining some opens Sydney sports groups, but they all already had strong cliques, and I didn't really find my place so I ended up just not doing it.

Eventually I found ice skating, which I used to love, but nowadays I don't know why - but every rink has decided they need to have the music so loud you can't even think.
Which then means I can't listen to my own music, or focus on the feeling of skating on the ice. So I kind of stopped that too.

So lately I haven't really been doing any sports, and I kind of miss it a bit.

### Gaming

I used to really love puzzle games, but as programming has become my career, that problem solving itch is already being scratched by that.
Because of that I've moved to more skills based games like FPS, but I only really enjoy the ones with some level of strategy rather than mindless shooters.

I really like Apex Legends, because once you get up to higher skill levels, aim isn't everything at all. It's a lot about picking the right points of the map to try and control.
Choosing who and when to target another team, when to try and slip past another team to get a better spot, when try and take their spot.
When to try and weaken a team so that another team tries to take them out. etc. It's pretty fun, but after a while it's not very fulfilling.
It's kind of nice as a think to play to take a break from thinking about the day, but it's not something I'd trade other things for or loose sleep over.

To be clear, I don't only like shooters, but most of the other types of games I play are fun because they're with friends or people, rather than me loving the game purely itself.

### Anime

I feel like I need to say this before you judge me, but I moved out of home when I was 18, into a share house filled on introverts who didn't talk.
So I'd often watch one episode during breakfast by myself in my room, and one during dinner. In just a year, that's an easy 600 episodes.
So even though I have watched 3500 episodes of anime, believe it or not, I did and do have a life, and anime isn't the be all and end all.
Though there are a lot of anime I like.

If you do watch anime and want to judge my tastes, here are my personal favorites, I don't think they're objectively the best anime,
but these are some that hold a special place in my heart:
    1. Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)
    2. Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai (The World God Only Knows)
    3. Chuunibyou demo koi ga Shitai (Love, Chunibyou & Other Delusions)
    4. Musaigen No Phantom World (Myriad Colors Phantom World)
    5. Mahoutsukai no Yomesan (The Ancient Magus' Bride)


## Insecurities

I just want to make this absolutely clear, I don't lose sleep over this, or worry about it all the time.
I mostly have control over this, it's just if I am to date anyone for an extended period of time I will probably slip up a couple of times.
This is a me issue, and I think I can get fully over it myself, but any help would be appreciated.

Basically my biggest, and basically only insecurity is that I feel second rate.
I can try really hard and things, and get really good to the point of being 2nd or 3rd at something, but I feel like I am never someone's primary.

I'm always their fallback.

Honestly I need to eat some humble pie, because there are lots of things I can do and have achieved that people can't even get to my level,
and I feel selfish complaining about never being able to be number one at something.
But it doesn't change the fact that it still stings being able to come so close, must just never quite there to a lot of things.
